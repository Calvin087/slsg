## Things I'd Like To Fix

- [ ] create a wrapper for cors allowed origins

## Conditions

- [x] All application code must be written using Javascript. Typescript is acceptable as well. Backend application is written in Node.js and frontend application written in React

- [x] Backend AWS Infrastructure needs to be automated with IAC using Serverless Framework

- [x] The API Gateway REST API should store data in DynamoDB

- [x] There should be 4-5 lambdas that include the following CRUD functionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete) \*don't use service proxy integration directly to DynamoDB from API Gateway

- [ ] Build the CI/CD pipeline to support multi-stage deployments e.g. dev, prod

- [ ] The template should be fully working and documented

- [ ] A public GitHub repository must be shared with frequent commits

- [ ] A video should be recorded (<www.loom.com>) of you talking over the application code, IAC, and any additional areas you want to highlight in your solution to demonstrate additional skills
